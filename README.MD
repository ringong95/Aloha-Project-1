# Summary
For our first project, we re-created fashion website using Html, CSS and git to submit it.

For the 2nd half of the project, we replaced all the floats from CSS into Flexbox, and used Javascript with Jquery to implement a smooth scrolling links and an image slider.

#What did i learn?

During this project i learned that making mistakes while working is not an issue as long as i can work past it. Using floats was difficult to understand at first. Flex box instead was simple to conceptually understand.  Java scipt felt overwhelming at first, learning so much so quickly however with all the resources and pratice i was able to implement it into the website easily with JQuiery.
